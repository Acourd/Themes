## How to Use:

***Prism Launcher 6.0 will add support for multiple custom themes at once***

***This section will be updated accordingly***

### Themes
- Open your local Prism Launcher Directory:

  -  on **Windows:** `%appdata%\PrismLauncher\themes\custom`

  -  on **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/PrismLauncher/themes/custom`

  -  on **Linux:** `~/.local/share/PrismLauncher/themes/custom`

  -  on **Flatpak:** `~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher/themes/custom`

- Replace theme.json and themeStyle.css with the custom files of your choice. (Note this will overwrite the pre existing files).

- Restart Prism Launcher, then open the global settings. In the Launcher section, click the User Interface tab, and under Colors (make sure you're changing Colors and not Icons!), choose the Custom pack. Click the Close button, and enjoy your new theme.

### Icons
- Open your local Prism Launcher Directory:

  -  on **Windows:** `%appdata%\PrismLauncher`

  -  on **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/PrismLauncher`

  -  on **Linux:** `~/.local/share/PrismLauncher`

  -  on **Flatpak:** `~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher`

- In this folder, create a new folder named iconthemes (if it doesn't already exist).

- Extract the contents of the zip into the Icons Themes folder.

- Restart Prism Launcher, then open the global settings. In the Launcher section, click the User Interface tab, and under Icons (make sure you're changing Icons and not Colors!), choose the Custom pack. Click the Close button, and enjoy your new icons.
